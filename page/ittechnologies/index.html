                <h2>What does it do?</h2>
                An autonomous vehicle is a vehicle than can sense its environment and is able to operate without human 
                involvement. The vehicle does not require a human passenger to take control, nor does it need a human 
                passenger to be inside the vehicle at all. An autonomous vehicle can do everything and go anywhere that an 
                experienced human driver and a traditional car can. (What is an Autonomous Car? – How Self-Driving Cars Work
                | Synopsys, 2021)<br> 
                <br>
                The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) currently defines 6 levels of driving automation ranging from Level 
                0 (fully manual) to level 5 (fully autonomous). These have now been globally accepted as the standard for 
                autonomous vehicle development.<br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Level 0: No autonomous functionality whatsoever, a traditional automobile operated exclusively by 
                        a human.</li>
                    <li>Level 1: Most driving functions are handled by a human, but one specific function (such as 
                        accelerating and decelerating with an adaptive cruise control system) is handled by the automobile.</li>
                    <li>Level 2: The automobile assumes all basic tasks (acceleration, braking, steering) associated with 
                        driving under some circumstances, but human intervention is required if the system miscalculates, and 
                        the human driver must always monitor the vehicle and its surroundings and be prepared to retake 
                        control.</li>
                    <li>Level 3: The automobile assumes all basic tasks associated with driving and monitors the vehicle 
                        and its environment to respond to unplanned circumstances. Human involvement is theoretically only 
                        required in case of an emergency scenario in which the vehicle fails to respond properly to its 
                        environment.</li>
                    <li>Level 4: The automobile assumes all driving tasks in specified environments (such as traffic jams), 
                        but a human driver is still required, and the vehicle must be capable of parking itself safely if 
                        the human driver is unable to retake control.</li>
                    <li>Level 5: Full automation with no human input required, the vehicle operates under its own control 
                        and can travel anywhere at any time without human occupants.</li>
                </ul>

                <img src="/images/SAElevels.jpg">
                Autonomous cars rely on a wide array of sensors, actuators, complex algorithms, machine learning systems, 
                and powerful processors to execute software. They can create and maintain a map of their surroundings based 
                on a variety of sensors situated in different parts of the vehicle. Radar sensors can monitor the position 
                of nearby vehicles. Video cameras can detect traffic lights, read road signs, track other vehicles, and 
                look for pedestrians. Lidar (light detection and ranging) sensors can bounce pulses of light off the car’s 
                surroundings to measure distances, detect road edges, and identify lane markings. Ultrasonic sensors in 
                the wheels can detect curbs and other vehicles when parking.<br>
                <br>
                Innovative software can then process all these sensory inputs, plot a path, and send instructions to the 
                car’s actuators, which control acceleration, braking, and steering. Hard-coded rules, obstacle avoidance 
                algorithms, predictive modelling, and object recognition help the software follow traffic rules and navigate 
                obstacles. (What is an Autonomous Car? – How Self-Driving Cars Work | Synopsys, 2021)<br>

                <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
                The advancement to a fully automated vehicle will not be a new or sudden concept, but more of a continuing 
                process with plenty of trials and tests, accumulating crucial information that is still lacking. They will 
                launch in different phases, varying with the level of autonomy. A level 5 fully autonomous vehicle will 
                probably take another decade or so before they hit the roads. However, level 4 autonomous cars will likely 
                be seen moving on the roads within the next few years. (The Future of Autonomous Cars | May 2020, 2021)<br>
                <br>
                The scenarios for convenience and quality of life improvements with the development of autonomous vehicles 
                are almost limitless. You could send your children to school using the car, and it could return home. The 
                elderly and the physically disabled would have the freedom and independence to go wherever they wanted. 
                It could drop you off at a point and head to a detected vacant parking spot rather than you having to drive 
                around looking for one. If someone perhaps forgot something at home, you could even send it to them using 
                the car. (What is an Autonomous Car? – How Self-Driving Cars Work | Synopsys, 2021)<br>
                <br>
                Perhaps the most important benefit of autonomous vehicles would be the decrease in number of accidents. 
                They can prevent human errors from happening as the system controls the vehicle. It leaves no opportunity 
                for distraction, unlike humans who are prone to interruptions. It also uses complicated algorithms that 
                determine the correct stopping distance between one vehicle to another. As autonomous vehicles replace manual 
                vehicles on the road, inevitably this will remove the roles and responsibilities of humans in driving. This 
                could impact the employment rate of services such as taxi drivers, truck drivers and pilots, as is similar 
                for many other industries that face automation. (Advantages And Disadvantages Of Autonomous Car – Half Fast

                Autonomous vehicles could result in a significant reduction in traffic congestion and faster travel times. 
                Autonomous cars could communicate with each other, as well as complex automated highway systems which could 
                direct traffic and identify traffic problems early. As there are fewer accidents and less traffic congestion, 
                there would be a significant drop in harmful emissions. According to Ohio University’s Future of Driving 
                report, harmful emissions will be reduced by 60% after the advent of autonomous vehicles. (7 benefits of 
                autonomous cars, 2021)<br>

                <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
                Currently I have a Learners driving license, and I am progressing towards a full driving license. As I do 
                not drive, I primarily use public transport such as the train as my main mode of transport, otherwise I would 
                be a passenger in a car, with someone else driving. Although I do plan to drive myself sooner or later, 
                autonomous vehicles would mostly likely become my primary mode of transport once it completes development. In 
                the most likely scenario, autonomous vehicles will replace almost all manual vehicles, such as autonomous 
                trains and buses. So even though I may still use public transport it would likely still be autonomous.<br>
                <br>
                I would probably have my own personal autonomous vehicle, and the same would be for my family and friends. 
                I would have a faster journey, and therefore save time that would have been spent travelling. Even in the 
                vehicle, as I am no longer required to manually drive the car, I can spend the time during the journey for my 
                own personal use, such as watching a film or doing some work.<br>
