                Hi, my name is Glenn, and I am a 21-year-old who is living in Melbourne. While both of my parents come from 
                China, I was born in Perth, Western Australia. Fortunately for me, this allowed me to become a native 
                speaker in English as well as have a good understanding of Mandarin. I enjoy watching various videos and 
                shows on YouTube and Netflix and to feed my pet dog Arrow food scraps from meals. When I was young, I was 
                always keen and enthusiastic to be able to use the computer, which back then we had to share. These 
                childhood experiences sparked my interest in all things IT related, and I have been invested ever since.

                <div class="slice"></div>
                Hi, I’m Tom Bradford and I am 32 years old. I have a background in the trade industry, I am a glazier by trade.
                I have been working with glass in high rise buildings from the age of 17. I also enlisted in the Royal Australian
                Regiment for five years from 2008 to 2013. During my enlistment, I was part of a couple operations with 8/9 RAR.
                I was deployed to East Timor and to Malaysia. I have not studied since I completed grade 11 in high school in 2006.
                More recently, I returned from a trip around Australia with my wife. We took a year off work to complete the lap with
                our 4WD and camper trailer. We had an absolute blast. My interest in IT is just the love of technology and how it
                helps us and entertains us in a way that just was not possible years ago. I cannot recall a particular event in my
                life that sparked my interest, I just know that I have always been intrigued by anything technology related. From a
                very young age I was always into my video games, remote control cars, computers and even playing snake 2 on my Nokia 3315. .

                <h2> Myers-Briggs Test</h2>
                <div class="slice"></div>
                <img src="/images/thomas/myers-briggs.png">
                I have recently undertaken a number of tests that may be used by employers during a recruitment process. The tests
                provided certain insights into my personality and learning style. A brief summary of the results of each test is detailed below. 
                Myers-Briggs Test After completing the Myers Briggs test, I got ESFJ-A or “Consul”(16 Personalities, 2011-2021). The Myers Briggs
                results were very detailed and included information about how my personality type’s strengths and weaknesses and approach to
                relationships and my career. Broadly, the test results reflect that Consuls are popular people, who enjoy being in the spotlight
                and leading others. People with a Consul personality take responsibility seriously and will base their moral compass on established
                traditions and law. Consuls enjoy participating in discussion, respect hierarchy and are loyal partners and employees. 
                I feel that the result of Consul is an accurate representation of my personality. I do enjoy being of service and consider myself
                supportive and outgoing. I have the personality type to be a good leader and I am good at managing several projects at one time. 
                The results provide a detailed list of strengths and weaknesses, which I believe will influence my behaviour in a team environment.
                As a positive, I have strong practical skills to offer a team, I am loyal and good at connecting with others. However, I am also
                inflexible at times, vulnerable to criticism and reluctant to innovate. These weaknesses obviously have the capacity to
                adversely impact those around me and have a negative influence on my team. By knowing my weaknesses, it will place me in
                a better position to recognise when I am displaying negative behaviours and work to address these in future. 
                In terms of how this will influence forming a team, I believe it is important to assemble a team of people who
                complement each other. Where I have an identified weakness, it is important to have others within a team that
                have a strength in that area.

                <h2>My Learning Style  </h2>
                <div class="slice"></div>
                <img src="/images/results.svg">
                In addition to the Myer’s Briggs test, I also took a test to assess my learning style (EducationPlanner, 2020). The results
                reflect that I am 40% auditory, 40% visual and 20% tactile, meaning that I am an Auditory/Visual Learner and learn through
                a combination of listening and looking. The test provided several tips to assist with auditory learning, including use of
                flashcards, reading information out loud and recording myself. As I am also a visual learner, the test recommended visualising
                things as I hear them, writing down key instructions and drawing pictures to explain new concepts.  
                My learning style requires both audio and visual prompts. Now that I am aware of this, I can ensure that I utilise the
                recommendations to ensure I am absorbing information as best I can. Through ensuring I am implementing best practice in my
                studies, I can ensure I am making the best possible contribution to my team. This will also influence how I form a team as
                I consider it would be beneficial if all team members had similar learning styles.

                <h2>Integrity Test</h2>
                <div class="slice"></div>
                <img src="/images/thomas/integrity-test.png">
                For the third test that you might be required to complete at a job interview, I completed an integrity test. (PsychologyToday, 2021).
                I completed this test as I believe that honesty and integrity are qualities that all employers will think highly of.  
                I received an honesty outlook of 78/100. For me, I think that this is a good result and reflects that I am trustworthy. I think
                that integrity is an important part of any team because you have to be able to trust your teammates. The test is indicative of
                the fact that people who are inclined to time theft and cyberloafing may be more inclined to take part in dishonest behaviours.
                If I observed these behaviours in a person, I would be less likely to consider including that person when forming a team.
