            <h1>Project Idea</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                Our group project idea is to develop a game using Unity. The project will be a platform type game
                (or platformer) and keeping into consideration that a complete game could take an extraordinary
                amount of time and effort which would be unfeasible, the project will aim to produce a demo version.
                In addition, the steps, and processes of developing a game would help us all advance our own skills
                and knowledge; and give us invaluable experiences required for our individual ideal jobs.<br><br>

                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                This project will aim to be interesting and entertaining for the user, whomever it may be. That
                being said, a possible future revision could see it entering the gaming market, one of the fastest
                growing sectors as of present. The global gaming market was valued at USD 162.32 billion in 2020 and
                is expected to reach a value of USD 295.63 billion by 2026. While there is a massive market for
                gaming, it is also highly competitive and dominated by big names and companies.<br><br>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                The project will be a platform action, side scroller game. The overall setting and theme of the game and
                its elements will be based on a medieval fantasy world; however, the story will have little importance
                in the actual gameplay which will be the primary focus. As this is our first time creating such a
                project, there will most likely (or rather almost certainly) be some alterations and changes to some of
                the described features and components at a future date.<br><br>

                The main objective for the player will be to progress, moving across from left to right collecting keys
                along the way. At the end there will be a gate which will be unlocked provided the player has collected
                the required number of keys. This will be the ‘end screen’ where the player has completed the game and
                end credits will be displayed. To get here the player will have to move and jump across platforms and
                figure out their way past obstacles and enemies. The player will have three lives where upon losing all
                three lives it is a ‘game over’ and the player will have to restart.<br><br>

                Obstacles will include things such as spikes and lava where if the player collides with them, the player
                loses a life. There will be various enemies, some which will move around or back and forth in a pattern
                and upon collision with these the player loses a life. There will also be enemies that shoot projectiles
                that go in straight lines and these projectiles also cause the player to lose a life upon
                collision.<br><br>

                The player will have movement such as left, right, and jump (up). They cannot ‘jump down’ or go through
                platforms. For movement, the user can use either arrow keys or WASD keys. The player can also kill
                enemies by jumping on top of them, colliding with the top of the enemy. Enemies that are killed will
                disappear, although on another start or restart of the game enemies will be back as normal.<br><br>

                There will be sound effects in the game, based on certain actions, events and interactions with the
                environment, and make the game more immersive and interactive. The game will also include an original
                soundtrack or OST, which will help create a distinctive atmosphere. The game will likewise have sprites
                and backgrounds which will be original. Having original art and music will be crucial in making the game
                as unique as possible, considering that there are an endless number of games in all sorts of varieties
                and genres already published.<br><br>

                The game will be developed for PC, creating versions for other platforms is still open but will not be
                produced in the foreseeable future. Eventually the game will be released through Steam, a video game
                digital distribution service where it can reach a wide audience and be distributed globally.<br><br>

                <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
                To develop the project, the essential hardware required is a PC and the relevant external components,
                such as a monitor, mouse, keyboard, etc. Otherwise, a decent laptop or something similar that can run
                the required software can be used. Required software include Unity, digital audio workstations like
                Studio One, and digital art software like Adobe Photoshop and Paint. Access to the internet and being
                able to communicate with the rest of the team working on the project is also essential. Microsoft Teams
                will be used as the main communication tool within the team.<br><br>

                <h2>Skills Required</h2>
                Project management would be important to lead the work of the team, to keep us on track and to meet
                our goals within the time limits. Being able to create a game with a game engine and having the
                fundamentals of programming will be an important skill for this project. Knowing these will make the
                majority of developing the game much easier. The project also requires the knowledge and skills of
                creating digital art with digital art software, as well as requiring the capability of creating
                digital audio and sounds with the relevant software. The skills and skillsets required are
                reasonably well covered by the member of the team, and the project is very much within the realm of
                possibility.

                <h2>Outcome</h2>
                The project’s goal is to provide entertainment and enjoyment for the user. Although not outside the
                realms of possibility, selling and making profit is not a core aim. If the user enjoys playing the game
                that this project produces, then it can be considered successful. This project’s main impact will be on
                the developers and team behind it, who will expectantly have furthered their understanding of game
                development, programming, using various software and IT.
