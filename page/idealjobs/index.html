            <h1>Ideal Jobs</h1>
            <section>
                In our team, we had an assortment of professions related to IT. Most ideal jobs were ‘hands on’ and
                technical, such as developers and engineers. These can be seen in Jennifer’s ideal job, C++ Developer,
                Jeremy’s ideal job, Software Engineer (graphics), and Glenn’s ideal job, Software Engineer in test. All
                three of the technical jobs involved a variant of C - either C, C#, or C++. Thomas’ ideal job was IT Manager
                and Roger’s was IT Specialist. <br><br>
        
                Jennifer would be in charge of “designing and developing software solutions” in C++. In addition to
                programming, she would also be in charge of “further development, optimization, and maintenance of these
                software systems (FreelancerMap, 2019)”.<br><br>
        
                Jeremy would be in charge of creating “integrated graphics and visual effects systems that are used in the
                design and development of software applications, such as video games and operating systems” (Study.com,
                2019).<br><br>
        
                Glenn would be responsible for developing “software for testing: tools, frameworks, and automated tests”
                (TestProject, 2018).<br><br>
        
                Roger would be in charge of the “implementation, monitoring, and maintenance of IT systems” (FieldFinder,
                n.d.).<br><br>
        
                Thomas would be responsible for the “overall performance of a company's electronic networks and leading the
                IT department in fulfilling the organization’s information systems requirements” (CareerExplorer, n.d.).<br><br>
        
                Although the career trajectories of these (oversimplified) subcategories of design, graphics, testing,
                support, and managerial vary widely, a common element they share at the root is that they are all based on
                the skills and information found in fields like Information Technology, Software Engineering, Computer
                Science.<br><br>
                
                Jennifer:
                <br>
                After having looked at the Burning Glass data, I would not want to change my ideal job. This is not because it did exceptionally well in the polling, but because I chose it as a matter of personal interest. Yes, maybe SQL is the highest in-demand skill, but it’s also rather boring and repetitive. I believe my ideal job intersects well with my interest, skills, desires, and professional goals, so despite it not ranking particularly well in BG’s top IT Job Titles list, I have no plans on changing it any time soon. 
                <br><br>
                
                Glenn:
                <br>
                The data from Burning Glass shows that while the IT-specific skills such as Git and Scrum are not as great in demand, the general skills are such as communication and teamwork are high in demand. Being a Software Engineer in Test would require skills that can be useful for a wide variety of IT related jobs. Ultimately, I would say that a Software Engineer in Test is still an ideal job, not the one and only job for me, but a job that I would like to have if possible.  
                <br><br>
                
                Roger:
                <br>
                My opinion of the burning glass has not changed because I am interested in IT and I like creativity and organisational skills and problem solving. The burning glass has skills in greatest demand baseline skills that I can help organise myself to have skills and develop new skills in my IT career. 
                <br><br>
                
                Thomas:
                <br>
                Having now reviewed the Burning Glass data, my opinion about my ideal job has not changed. If anything, the data has strengthened my views regarding my ideal job. This is because the data reflects that IT Managers have good job security and that the work could be both interesting and challenging. In my view, I would perform well if placed in a leadership role. 
                <br><br>
                
                Jeremy:
                <br>
                Upon reflection, I still would very much like to get into the field of Software Engineering. There is a lot of demand for Software Engineering, and there is always something new to learn. The pay isn’t that bad either. A senior role is something I would like to aim for, but the road towards that goal is more important to me. Self-development is a major factor in my choice of ideal job.
