            <h1>Ideal Jobs</h1>
            <section>
                In our team, we had an assortment of professions related to IT. Most ideal jobs were ‘hands on’ and
                technical, such as developers and engineers. These can be seen in Jennifer’s ideal job, C++ Developer,
                Jeremy’s ideal job, Software Engineer (graphics), and Glenn’s ideal job, Software Engineer in test. All
                three of the technical jobs involved a variant of C - either C, C#, or C++. Thomas’ ideal job was IT Manager
                and Roger’s was IT Specialist. <br><br>
        
                Jennifer would be in charge of “designing and developing software solutions” in C++. In addition to
                programming, she would also be in charge of “further development, optimization, and maintenance of these
                software systems (FreelancerMap, 2019)”.<br><br>
        
                Jeremy would be in charge of creating “integrated graphics and visual effects systems that are used in the
                design and development of software applications, such as video games and operating systems” (Study.com,
                2019).<br><br>
        
                Glenn would be responsible for developing “software for testing: tools, frameworks, and automated tests”
                (TestProject, 2018).<br><br>
        
                Roger would be in charge of the “implementation, monitoring, and maintenance of IT systems” (FieldFinder,
                n.d.).<br><br>
        
                Thomas would be responsible for the “overall performance of a company's electronic networks and leading the
                IT department in fulfilling the organization’s information systems requirements” (CareerExplorer, n.d.).<br><br>
        
                Although the career trajectories of these (oversimplified) subcategories of design, graphics, testing,
                support, and managerial vary widely, a common element they share at the root is that they are all based on
                the skills and information found in fields like Information Technology, Software Engineering, Computer
                Science.<br><br>
