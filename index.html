                Hi, my name is Glenn, and I am a 21-year-old who is living in Melbourne. While both of my parents come from 
                China, I was born in Perth, Western Australia. Fortunately for me, this allowed me to become a native 
                speaker in English as well as have a good understanding of Mandarin. I enjoy watching various videos and 
                shows on YouTube and Netflix and to feed my pet dog Arrow food scraps from meals. When I was young, I was 
                always keen and enthusiastic to be able to use the computer, which back then we had to share. These 
                childhood experiences sparked my interest in all things IT related, and I have been invested ever since.

                <div class="slice"></div>
 Hi, I’m Tom Bradford and I am 32 years old. I have a background in the trade industry, I am a glazier by trade. I have been working with glass in high rise buildings from the age of 17. I also enlisted in the Royal Australian Regiment for five years from 2008 to 2013. During my enlistment, I was part of a couple operations with 8/9 RAR. I was deployed to East Timor and to Malaysia. I have not studied since I completed grade 11 in high school in 2006. More recently, I returned from a trip around Australia with my wife. We took a year off work to complete the lap with our 4WD and camper trailer. We had an absolute blast. My interest in IT is just the love of technology and how it helps us and entertains us in a way that just was not possible years ago. I cannot recall a particular event in my life that sparked my interest, I just know that I have always been intrigued by anything technology related. From a very young age I was always into my video games, remote control cars, computers and even playing snake 2 on my Nokia 3315. .

                <h2> Myers-Briggs Test</h2>
                <div class="slice"></div>
                <img src="/profile.PNG">
                I have recently undertaken a number of tests that may be used by employers during a recruitment process. The tests provided certain insights into my personality and learning style. A brief summary of the results of each test is detailed below. 
Myers-Briggs Test After completing the Myers Briggs test, I got ESFJ-A or “Consul”(16 Personalities, 2011-2021). The Myers Briggs results were very detailed and included information about how my personality type’s strengths and weaknesses and approach to relationships and my career. Broadly, the test results reflect that Consuls are popular people, who enjoy being in the spotlight and leading others. People with a Consul personality take responsibility seriously and will base their moral compass on established traditions and law. Consuls enjoy participating in discussion, respect hierarchy and are loyal partners and employees. 
I feel that the result of Consul is an accurate representation of my personality. I do enjoy being of service and consider myself supportive and outgoing. I have the personality type to be a good leader and I am good at managing several projects at one time. 
The results provide a detailed list of strengths and weaknesses, which I believe will influence my behaviour in a team environment. As a positive, I have strong practical skills to offer a team, I am loyal and good at connecting with others. However, I am also inflexible at times, vulnerable to criticism and reluctant to innovate. These weaknesses obviously have the capacity to adversely impact those around me and have a negative influence on my team. By knowing my weaknesses, it will place me in a better position to recognise when I am displaying negative behaviours and work to address these in future. 
In terms of how this will influence forming a team, I believe it is important to assemble a team of people who complement each other. Where I have an identified weakness, it is important to have others within a team that have a strength in that area.

                <h2>My Learning Style  </h2>
                <div class="slice"></div>
                <img src="/results.svg">
In addition to the Myer’s Briggs test, I also took a test to assess my learning style (EducationPlanner, 2020). The results reflect that I am 40% auditory, 40% visual and 20% tactile, meaning that I am an Auditory/Visual Learner and learn through a combination of listening and looking.  
The test provided several tips to assist with auditory learning, including use of flashcards, reading information out loud and recording myself. As I am also a visual learner, the test recommended visualising things as I hear them, writing down key instructions and drawing pictures to explain new concepts.  
My learning style requires both audio and visual prompts. Now that I am aware of this, I can ensure that I utilise the recommendations to ensure I am absorbing information as best I can. Through ensuring I am implementing best practice in my studies, I can ensure I am making the best possible contribution to my team. This will also influence how I form a team as I consider it would be beneficial if all team members had similar learning styles.

                <h2>Integrity Test</h2>
                <div class="slice"></div>
                <img src="/chart.PNG">
For the third test that you might be required to complete at a job interview, I completed an integrity test. (PsychologyToday, 2021). I completed this test as I believe that honesty and integrity are qualities that all employers will think highly of.  
I received an honesty outlook of 78/100. For me, I think that this is a good result and reflects that I am trustworthy. I think that integrity is an important part of any team because you have to be able to trust your teammates. The test is indicative of the fact that people who are inclined to time theft and cyberloafing may be more inclined to take part in dishonest behaviours. If I observed these behaviours in a person, I would be less likely to consider including that person when forming a team.

            <h1>Project Idea</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
        Our project idea is to develop a game using the game engine Unity. The project will be a platform type game, or
        platformer. Acknowledging that making a complete game could take an extraordinary amount of time, effort, and
        money, which would be unfeasible for the scope of this project, we have decided to produce a demo version of the
        game. By completing this project, we hope to gain some of the experience, knowledge, and skills required for our
        dream jobs.</p>
<br>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>This project has the realistic goals of being interesting and entertaining for the user. Though notably, a
            future expansion to develop the game fully could see it entering the gaming market, one of the fastest
            growing sectors of present. The global gaming market was valued at USD 162.32 billion in 2020 and is
            expected to reach a value of USD 295.63 billion by 2026. While there is a massive market for gaming, it is
            also highly competitive and dominated by big names and companies.</p>
            <br>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The project will be a platform, action, side-scroller game. The overall setting and theme of the game and its
            elements will be based on a story; however, the story will have little importance in the actual gameplay
            which will be the primary focus. As this is my first time creating such a project, there will almost
            certainly be some alterations and changes to some of the described features and components at a future date.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>The main objective for the player will be to progress, moving across from left to right, where there will be
            an end goal. The player will have to move and jump across platforms and figure out their way past obstacles
            and enemies. The player will have movement such as left, right, and jump. Movement will come from arrow key
            inputs from the user. The player will also have an attack function to use against enemies which will likely
            come from the spacebar key.</p>
        <p>There will be sound effects in the game, based on certain actions, events and interactions with the
            environment.
        <p>

        <p>Ideally, the game would also include an original soundtrack or OST. However, since our team does not have
            experience in creating music, this will most likely require outsourcing and is such something to consider
            after the demo version is released.</p>

        <p>The game will also have objects, sprites and backgrounds. These would preferably be original, but as
            technical art and drawing is not in our team’s skill set, it will also require outsourcing.</p>

        <p>We acknowledge that having original art and music will be crucial in making the game as unique and marketable
            as possible, especially considering that there are an endless number of games already published. However,
            considering the time and budget constraints, these will be future developments.</p>

        <p>Initially, the game will be made for PC, with the possibility of a mobile version being made later.
            Eventually the game will be released through Steam, a video game digital distribution service where it can
            reach a wide audience and be distributed globally.</p>

            <br>
        <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
        <p>In order to develop this project, we need both hardware and software. The essential hardware required is a PC
            and its peripherals - a monitor, mouse, keyboard, etc. Alternatively, a laptop or something similar that can
            run the required software will also be sufficient. The required software includes a game engine such as
            Unity or Unreal, a digital audio workstation such as Studio One, and digital art software like Adobe
            Photoshop. Access to the internet and communication tools with team members is also essential.</p>
            <br>
        <h2>Skills Required</h2>
        <p>We have four major skill sets we required for this project: management, programming, art, and music. Project
            management is an important aspect of this project as someone will be required to lead the team in order to
            keep us on track and to meet our goals before the deadline. Programming and experience creating a game with
            a game engine is another important skill for this project, as it will reduce the amount of time required to
            develop the game itself. We will also require an artist to create the sprites, backgrounds and digital art
            in general. Finally, we will require someone proficient in using digital audio workstation (DAW) to create
            the audio and soundtracks for this project. Acquiring these various skills should be feasible, if not for
            our demo then for our full version.</p>
            <br>
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>The project’s goal is simply to provide entertainment and enjoyment for the user. Although, making a profit
            by selling the game is not outside the realm of possibility, it is also not a core aim for us. We are not
            motivated by money, but by developing ourselves as IT professionals. This project will help us develop our
            knowledge and understanding of game development, programming, collaboration, and time management, and as
            such, we are thankful for being given the opportunity to work on it. In the end, we will consider our
            project a success if our users enjoy playing our game.</p>
